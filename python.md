## Introduction

python is a High-level programming language.
Crated by "Guido van Rossum in 1991."

It is a general purpose programming language and is used in various sector such as :-
- web dev
- software developement
- machine learning tasks & AI
- database handling 
- automation & many more.

**Why use python ?**
- python works on multi-platform such as (windows, mac, linux, pi, etc).
- It has simple syntax similar to english language.
- It runs on an interpreter system . 
- Python can be treated in Procedural as well as  -Object-oriented and functional way.
- The most recent major version of Python is Python 3 and python has a good community of developers



## Installation
Instructions on how to install Python on different operating systems.

**1. On Windows**
    
 **1. Download Python Installer:**

[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 The website should automatically suggest the latest version of Python for Windows. 
 Click the "Download Python" button.

**2. Run the Installer:**

 Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now." 
 This will ensure you can run Python from the command line without needing to specify its full path.

```



## Basic Syntax

Overview of Python syntax and basic programming constructs.

For a detailed explanation, refer to [syntax.py](general_syntax/syntax.py).

## Variables
In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated during program execution. 

For a detailed explanation on what is variable , variable assingment , type and type casting , naming convention , refer to [understanding_variables](python_basic/understanding_variables).

## Input Output
Understanding input and output operations is fundamental to Python programming. With the print() function, we can display output in various formats, while the input() function enables interaction with users by gathering input during program execution.

For a detailed explanation on input , output , refer to [Input Output folder](input_output).
