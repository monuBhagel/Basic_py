'''
-  so far we did -> open a file -> do the operation such as read /write -> close it manually.

- we can avoid this by using the context managers the "with" statement.
- syntax :
        with open(fileName , mode) as alias
        
its the replacement of :
        alias = open(file_name , mode)
        
-  also we don't need to clsoe the file now. as it is done implicitly.
