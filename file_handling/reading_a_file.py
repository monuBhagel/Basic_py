'''
- reading a file in python is easy . just 
    - open it in read mode.
    - take content in a varible.
    - print it .

# reading example
from file_path import example_txt

    file = open(example_txt,'r')

# above code open the file and throw error if it is not present.
    
# now reading the content of it.

'''
- Once a file is opened, we can read its contents using various methods:
  
   -  file.read(size): Reads the entire file or a specified number of   bytes.
   -  file.readline(): Reads the next line from the file.
   -  file.readlines(): Reads all lines into a list.
