Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin.
The first two words themselves are a truncation of dolorem ipsum ("pain itself").this is line 4.this is line 5.👍
