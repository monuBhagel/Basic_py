# Generally , variables are used to store data values in a program . but in python , variables are actually the references to the objects in the memory 

# variables act as the "placeholder" for the data . they allow us to store and manipulate data in a program .



# Creating a variable in python 

'''variable_name = value/data'''

num = 5
