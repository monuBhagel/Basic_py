# Rules for Naming Variables

- Variable name can only contain :-
    - letters
    - digits
    - underscore (_)
- A variable name can not start with a digit.
- Variable names are case sensitive i.e x != X {x is not equall to X}.
- Python keywords can not be used as name for variable.
- long variable names are declared using "Snake_caseing"

## Valid Examples

    num = 10
    num1 = 5  # although this is acceptable, but it reduces the readability.
    num_1 = 5  # can use this if have to.
    name = "Ashok"
    salary_in_rupee = 35,589

## Invalid Examples

    1num = 10
    class = 5  # "class" is a reserved keyword 
    user-name = "ashok"  # this contain hypen
